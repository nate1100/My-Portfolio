# Project 1: PHISHCHECK: A BROWSER-BASED EXTENSION FOR PHISHING ATTACK DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING APPROACH <br />
## Project Overview
*Collected large dataset from multiple resources including Phishtank,OpenPhish and Kaggle.<br />
*Discovered the phishing anomaly using supervised algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM and XGBoost in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, f-measure and confusion matrix.<br />
*Identified the characteristics of phishing URLs.<br />
*Developed a browser-based extension that shall automatically categorize each URL as legitimate or phishing.

## Architectural Paradigm of the Study
This project used two important components further understand the cycle: the PhishCheck Chrome extension, which serves as the front-end, and Python, which serves as the study's back-end. Front-end components such as pop-up window and background scripts are some of the important parts of chrome extensions that were navigated first when users visit a website or enter a url in the pop-up address bar. <br />
