# PROJECT 3: Analysis of a Tumor Dataset Using Association Rule Mining in R and WEKA <br />
## Project Overview
*The Apriori algorithm and filtered associator algorithm are applied in the tumor dataset to analyze the relationships between locations of tumors in each class and to make a comparison of the performance of the two applied algorithms.<br/>
*Create data visualizations using Weka tool and R. 

## Dataset Used
The primary tumor dataset has been selected for analysis of the association rule. The dataset was obtained from the University Medical Centre, Institute of Oncology, Ljubljana, Yugoslavia[18] and downloaded directly from openml.org. It is composed of 18 attributes, 339 instances and one class attribute. The dataset is also composed of attributes about the primary tumor locations. These locations are the parts of the body where the tumor first appeared and then spread to other parts of the body.

## Data Visualizations 
### Age Group
Based on the age group figure, it can be observed that most data comes from the age group of 30-59 and little inputs can be found in age below 30. This can be interpreted that most people develop tumors in the ages above 30.

### Sex Group
In sex group, there are no significant difference between which gender develops a tumor regardless of age.

### Histologic Types of cancer
These data show which type of cancer developed with the primary tumor. It can be seen that the “adeno” has a significant difference between the other two histologic types. On the other hand, “no_info” indicates that there is no histologic type of cancer that came with the primary tumor.

### Classes
Classes, the most common location where the tumor has metastasized is the lungs. Followed by stomach, ovary, pancreas, and breast respectively. The least common locations are the testis, vagina, salivary glands,  cervix, and bladder.

### Mined Rules using Apriori Algorithm

The figure presents the visualizations of the results from the mined rules using apriori algorithm. The plot function and its graph parameter has been used. The closer the rule node is to the center, the more significant it is.

*Only the top three classes with the most instances have been used here as an example. The Lung class with 84 instances, Stomach with 39 instances, and lastly the Ovary with 29 instances. These classes used 5% as the lower bound value for the support and 0.8 confidence as the minimum value for selection.*
